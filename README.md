# EtcAbductionPy

## An implementation of Etcetera Abduction in Python

This software is a reference implementation of Etcetera Abduction. Given a knowledge base of first-order definite clauses and a set of observables, this software identifies the most probable set of assumptions that logically entails the observations, assuming the conditional independence of each assumption.
